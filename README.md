# Hello World: The Logic of Interaction

##### FALL 2019

##### INSTRUCTORS: Carrie Kengle, Bruno Kruse

##### WEBSITE: [hello-world.areaofeffect.io](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/)

##### This is a repository for all my assignments for this subject.



## Assignments Week 1



## Assignments Week 2

### Assignment 1
Pick four objects in everyday life and represent them as a data type.

### Assignment 2
Create an object and verify it using https://jsonlint.com/

### Assignment 3
Create your own story algorithm. You can modify an example from class (story maker) or create your own. Remember to comment your code and use examples of:
	- user inputs
	- variables (int or float, string, boolean)
	- concatenation



## Assignments Week 3

### Create a logic game!

Design and build a game of your own using different types of operators:

- [arithmetic](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#8) ```=``` ```+``` ```/``` ```-``` ```%```

- [comparison](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#13) ```!=``` ```==``` ```>``` ```<``` ```>=``` ```<=```

- [logical](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#16) ```and``` ```(&&)``` , ```or``` ```(||)``` , ```not``` ```(!)```

- [conditional statements](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#23) ```if``` ```elif``` ```else```

- [functions](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#29)

Some inspirations can be: puzzle games, a sudoku checker, a card or dice games, escape the room type game or the [sample forest game](https://github.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/tree/master/week3/examples) game from class.

To start, it will help to break down your game as variables, datatypes and objects. Use a flow-chart and plan your game before writing any code. You can work in groups of 2, pair coding. Next week we will be play-testing our games in class.



## Assignments Week 4

Create a generative artwork or study using loops and repetition.



## Assignments Week 5

### Visualizing Sensor Data
Visualize live sensor data from Arduino to your browser.



## Assignments Week 6

Choose one of the following programming assignments below. Rember to create a folder for your project and upload to GitHub when you are done. If you need help going through debugging remember to first check online, there is a chance someone else has gotten the same error as you! If you are still stuck ask your classmates, pair-programming or in slack.

#### CODE OPTION 1. Choose an element of interactivity to make a sketch, drawing or game! You can use Keyboard, Mouse, Touch or other methods we discussed in class. If you get stuck for ideas you can try remaking your interactive python game in p5 or review our class notes from week 6. 

Remember:

- mouseX, mouseY, and [mouse events](http://week6-hello-world.areaofeffect.io/#simple-drawing)
- keyboard input (key, keycode)
- Classes ([jitterbugs](https://gist.github.com/brunokruse/fcd85f3ec8c1da3f2b6759d152360611)) are your friend.
- loadImage(), image()
- and more!

<br/>

#### CODE OPTION 2. Take "Almost pong" and make it a real game.

- http://week6-hello-world.areaofeffect.io/#simple-pong
- add a second player and scores
- run it in a seperate HTML file with larger game window
- make your own controls!
- (advanced) try control the players with potentiometers (or something else!) + arduino
- (advanced) try controlling the paddles with your phone + rotation!
